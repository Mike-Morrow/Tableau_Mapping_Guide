# Tableau Mapping Reference
Tableau at its core is a tool for people to ask and answer questions of their data. Many of these questions start with the interrogative where. While Tableau is broader than a pure GIS program, its ability to tie spatial data into other datasets to answer where questions is special.
## Categories
## Connecting/preparing data
### Connecting to geographic data
### Geo and non geo data sources
*quick aside on geographic data types
### Dealing with geo data that isnâ€™t a geo data type
*note on preprocessing
### Spatial joins
## Creating maps
### Plotting points
*note on generated vs non-generated lat lons
### Plotting polygons
### Plotting lines/paths
*note on creating lines and paths
### Plotting multiple geographic fields
### Visualizing density
### Calculating distance
*make a note this is only for points and is as the crow flies
#### Hexmaps
#### Density maps
### Spatial drill downs
*note simple dashboard actions + set actions
### Adding background layers
### Creating indoor maps / floor plans
*note on background images
## Integrations and Extensibility
### Preprocessing data sets
*geocoding addresses
*extracting spatial information (e.g. calculating areas)
*generating new spatial fields from existing (e.g. buffers, isochrones, geostatistics)
*manipulating existing (e.g. smoothing)
### Advanced calculations
*advanced distance calculations (point to line, line to line, polygon to point, polygon to line, polygon to polygon)
*drive time calculations or network analysis
*anything involving z coordinate / altitude
### 3d mapping and other alternative maps
